# Making changing backgrounds
I found this amazing background of Outset Island from LoZ The Wind Waker. It has 4 images that on MacOS change with the time of day. I thought "hey, this shouldn't be too hard to do myself, right?". And thus started an adventure of lots of tangent and way to much effort for such a small thing. Sometimes however it is the smallest tasks that you learn the most from.
