In class I would sit there entranced when the teacher brought out examples for projects.

"This is a previous students biography book. See how she named each section creatively? Some sections are poems, some are collages, it is a great example of what you could do with this project!" Mrs. Jackson gushes.

I always wanted to be that student. The one special student that completed their work so well that the teacher couldn't help but hold on to it to show future years to come. I would fantasize about it.
