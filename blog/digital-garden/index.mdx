# What is a Digital Garden? 

I learned of this concept by accident really. I am not even entirely sure exactly where I found it. Someones post about some obscure thing I was trying to do surely. But it is a place to plant your thoughts and let them grow organically. An understanding that our minds don't work in linears - we don't really care about time or the date of which we had a thought we needed to share. And that really thoughts lead to more thoughts; one showers thought is the next days coffee break musing, which might lead to a week long spiral. 

## What do I want in my garden
* Back links: I want a way for thoughts to lead to thoughts and then be able to remember how the *heck* I got here
* Formal thoughts and guides
* Nonsense thoughts and half formed ideas
* A dev blog of sorts where I can talk through things I am doing. Mostly highlighting the true steps I took, failures and all. 

I am going to make it in [Gatsby](../gatsby-website)
