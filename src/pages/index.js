      <p>I am a software developer, amateur analog photographer, endurance athlete, and lover of my cat Percy (oh and also my husband Mitch). I am currently working at Microsoft in Azure DNS where I support the Linux based authoritative serving plane. On this website, you can learn more about me and my professional experience, read through various thoughts I have explored, and see some of my various projects. 
      <br></br> 
      <br></br> 
      This website is a work in progress - it likely always be, but right now especially. I hope to carve out this little space on the internet for myself with the goal that I create and contribute more to the ether instead of consume, consume, <b>consume</b>. If you are interested to see my journey, I hope you check back in here from time to time! </p>
